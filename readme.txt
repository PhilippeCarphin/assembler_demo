Demonstration of how to understand assembler

In the first part, I will show how to figure out by oneself how to write
assembler looking at how an expert does it ;)

Then I will continue to get this expert to reveal to me more tricks.

And we will see that sometimes knowing how this expert translates C code
into assembler will allow us to write better C code.
